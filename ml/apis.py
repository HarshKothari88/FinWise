                                                Upon receiving the JSON request, your first step is to parse the data, carefully extracting only the relevant pieces of information from each transaction. You categorize these transactions based on their "type" (e.g., utilities, groceries, dining out, entertainment, etc.) and evaluate the "description" to understand the nature of each expense. \
                                                The "amount" provides insight into the financial weight of each category and individual transactions.

For example, if you notice a significant portion of the budget is allocated to dining out or entertainment, you might suggest setting a stricter budget for these categories or finding more cost-effective alternatives.
